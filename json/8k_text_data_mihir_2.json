\u201cexpect\u201d, \u201cestimate\u201d, \u201cintend\u201d, \u201cplan\u201d, \u201cgoal\u201d, \u201cbelieve\u201d, \u201caim\u201d, \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cmay\u201d, \u201cwould\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d or other words of similar meaning or the negative thereof, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. forward-looking statements include statements relating to the following: (i) future capital expenditures, expenses, revenues, economic performance, financial conditions, dividend policy, losses and future prospects, (ii) business and management strategies and the expansion and growth of the operations of nortonlifelock or avast, (iii) the effects of government regulation on the business of nortonlifelock or avast, and (iv) the time frame and the expected benefits of the transaction to nortonlifelock, avast, and their respective customers, stockholders and investors, including expected growth, earnings accretion and cost savings. there are many factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. such factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the transaction will not be completed on a timely basis or at all, whether due to the failure to satisfy the conditions of the transaction (including approvals or clearances from regulatory and other agencies and bodies) or otherwise, general business and ecvonomic conditions globally, industry trends, competition, changes in government and other regulation, changes in political and economic stability, disruptions in business operations due to reorganization activities, interest rate and currency fluctuations, the inability of the combined entity to realize successfully any anticipated synergy benefits when (and if) the transaction is implemented, the inability of the combined entity to integrate successfully nortonlifelock\u2019s and avast\u2019s operations when (and if) the transaction is implemented, fluctuations and volatility in nortonlifelock\u2019s stock price, the ability of nortonlifelock to successfully execute strategic plans, the ability of nortonlifelock to maintain customer and partner relationships, the timing and market acceptance of new product releases and upgrades, matters arising out of the ongoing u.s. securities and exchange commission (the \u201csec\u201d) investigation and the combined entity incurring and/or experiencing unanticipated costs and/or delays or difficulties relating to the transaction when (and if) it is implemented. additional information concerning these and other risk factors is contained in the risk factors sections of nortonlifelock\u2019s most recent reports on form 10-k and form 10-q, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference into, nor do they form part of, this presentation. these forward-looking statements are based on numerous assumptions regarding the present and future business strategies of such persons and the environment in which each will operate in the future. by their nature, these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, as well as uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. the factors described in the context of such forward-looking statements in this presentation may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of any such person, or industry results and developments, to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. no assurance\ncan be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct and persons reading this presentation are

attributable to nortonlifelock or avast or any persons acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statement above. neither of nortonlifelock or avast undertakes any obligation to update publicly or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent required by applicable law, regulation

shareholders the materials herein contain information in respect of the transaction. viewing this information may be unlawful if you are resident or located in any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws and regulations or would result in a requirement to comply with any governmental or other consent or any registration, filing or other formality which nortonlifelock regards as unduly onerous (each, a \u201crestricted jurisdiction\u201d). in certain jurisdictions, including restricted jurisdictions, only certain categories of persons may be allowed to view such materials. all persons resident or located outside the united kingdom who wish to view these materials must first satisfy themselves that they are not subject to any local requirements that prohibit or restrict them from doing so and should inform themselves of, and observe, any legal or regulatory requirements applicable in their jurisdiction. it is your responsibility to satisfy yourself as to the full observance of any relevant laws and regulatory requirements. copies of this presentation and any formal documentation relating to the transaction are not being, and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed, transmitted, or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, whole or in part, into or from any restricted jurisdiction, including any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of such jurisdiction, and persons receiving such documents (including, without limitation, custodians, nominees and trustees) should observe these restrictions and must not mail, transmit, otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any restricted jurisdiction. doing so may render invalid any related purported vote in respect of acceptance of the transaction. neither nortonlifelock, nor any of its members, directors, officers, employees, advisers, agents, affiliates or representatives, assumes any responsibility for any violation by any person of any of these restrictions. further details in relation to avast shareholders in overseas jurisdictions will be contained in the scheme document and/or offer document. notice to u.s. investors in avast the transaction relates to the acquisition of the securities of an english company, and is expected to be implemented pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under english law. a transaction implemented by means of a scheme of arrangement is not subject to the tender offer rules of the u.s. exchange act of 1934, as amended. accordingly, the transaction is subject to disclosure requirements and practices applicable in the uk to schemes of arrangement which differ from the disclosure and procedural requirements of us tender offer rules. any financial information included in this presentation may have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the united kingdom and thus may not be comparable to financial information of us companies or companies whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states. if nortonlifelock exercises its right in the future to implement the transaction by way of a takeover offer, that offer will be made in compliance with applicable us laws and regulations. it may be difficult for us holders of the avast shares to enforce their\nrights and claims arising out of the us federal securities laws, since avast is located in a country other than the united states, and some or all of its officers and directors are residents of a country other than the united states. us holders of avast\u2019s shares may not be able to sue a non-us company or its officers or directors in a non-us court for violations of the us securities laws. further, it may be difficult to compel a non-us company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a us court\u2019s judgement. use of non-gaap financial information we use the non-gaap measures of operating margin and earnings per share, which are adjusted from results based on u.s. gaap and exclude certain expenses, gains and losses. we also provide the non-gaap metric of free cash flow, which is defined as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. these non-gaap financial measures are provided to enhance the user\u2019s understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future. our management team uses these non-gaap financial measures in assessing nortonlifelock\u2019s performance, as well as in planning and forecasting future periods. these non-gaap financial measures are not computed according to u.s. gaap and the methods we use to compute them may differ from the methods used by other companies. non-gaap financial measures are supplemental, should not be considered a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with u.s. gaap and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap. readers are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-gaap financial measure earnings per share to the comparable u.s. gaap results, which is attached to our quarterly earnings release and which can be found, along with other financial information, on the investor relations page of our website at https://investor.nortonlifelock.com. we are unable to provide a reconciliation of forward-looking non-gaap financial measures to the most comparable u.s. gaap financial measures because certain information is dependent on future events, some of which are outside the control of nortonlifelock. moreover, estimating such u.s. gaap financial measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. no profit forecasts or estimates no statement in this presentation is intended as,
